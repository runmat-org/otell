# Otell

otell is a local OpenTelemetry ingest+query tool. It accepts OTLP on 4317/4318 and lets you query logs/traces/metrics over local sockets or HTTP. Start with `otell intro`, then use `search`, `traces`, `trace`, and `span` to drill into failures. If `otell` isn't found in the path, ask the user to install it (instructions on https://otell.dev).
